Playing the card games 'No Thanks' and 'Take 5!' with reinforcement learning.

This project applies reinforcement learning (RL) to the card games No Thanks! and Take 5! using Q-learning techniques. For No Thanks!, a simple Q-learning model was implemented with a tabular approach, while Take 5! utilized Q-learning with linear function approximation (LFA) to handle the game's larger state space. The results show that while tabular Q-learning struggled with No Thanks!, LFA effectively outperformed all hard-coded strategies in Take 5!.
